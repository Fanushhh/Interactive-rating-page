### What I learned

Some of the major struggles that I've had with this challenge was getting the input from a page into another page because initially, I thought that would be the only way. However, I learned that there are infinite possibilities when it comes to how to do something so started digging and discovered through other people's projects that you can actually make both pages on the same html body and just have one hidden until you say otherwise.
After that, it was mostly figuring out how the hell can you make that transition with the stored value of your selection.

Amazing challenge, a bit harder than the previous QR one, but nice nonetheless.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp) - This helped me understand how to select an element from the page and assign it different properties on click.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp) - I used this one because at some point I wanted to modify an element inside another class, but just that, for instance, a p element inside a div, so naturally I used something like a class .randomClass p{} and it worked like a charm.
